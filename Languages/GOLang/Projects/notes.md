### How it's working
Websites create RSS feeds, which are **XML files that contain summaries of their latest content, including titles, descriptions, and links.**
Users use RSS readers (also known as **feed readers** or aggregators) to subscribe to these feeds.
The RSS reader **periodically checks the subscribed feeds for updates and displays them to the user.**
