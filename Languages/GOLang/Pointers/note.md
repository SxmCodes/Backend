# Pointers

### Why to use pointers?
So basically, If you are too much into performance and things like that, you can use pointers, becasue if you pass the values, it get copied and then passed. So to avoid that thing, you can pass pointers. 
In pointers, you can have that value passed and changed in real time. 

But pointers are a bit dangerous, if not used properly they can lead to bugs. 

We have ```%v``` as a data specifier. There is nothing too much to talk about in pointers.
